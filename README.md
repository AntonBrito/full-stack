                      Under Construction!

OndaSuave its an app that helps users make an appoitment with massage therapy or get schedulle of different events as yoga classes and more that will be add later.


                        User stories


-As a user we can sign up and sign in(log in)

_A user can sign up with their email and password provide by the user.

-As a user we can change password or signout.

-As a user after sign up, we can have access to get schedulle or make an appoitment according with your daily schedulle

-As a user we can have good information or news about events thats its happening or that its coming.

-As developer I will work on this app to provide more to clients and the employers.

-As a user we can create an appointment using user id, email and pick a date.

-Eventually I would like setup a way to read that after schedulling a appointment user can see their name on an form with date and time.

                      The purppose of this ondasuave

       Onda Suave its an name that I puted together by two words that means Suave-smooth Onda-wave. I like the idea about wave and energy. Our body is constaly producing waves of vibrations it can be positve/negative or neutro.

       WIth this app clients will be abble to get their local class going and massage services avaibble as well.

       Eventually I will work on this project and make it more official to be more useful and helpfull to the clients and employers.

       Couples and Families will have their schedulles updated for their routine Childbirth classes.



        During this project

        We had few days to make an web application that can send our data between backserver and front server with our clients.

        I used ERD diagram to design my database tabbles and Wireframe.cc to design my wireframe. I used Ruby Rails to create my tabbles on database, and made sure it was establishing a good connection with our platform.

        I used html to make the structures of our app and the css for the customazation of the page.

        I used Dropdown feature to hide (organize) the sign forms.

        I made sure my api ui and event.js were stabblising the connetction with server and would allow us to sign up/in/out and change password.

        I used jquerry to allow the event handleres.

        I used jquerry to allow us to hide the table and to show it after the is been pressing or after sign in with your account.

        I used a Bootstrap customaztion form, to the making an appoitment form.
